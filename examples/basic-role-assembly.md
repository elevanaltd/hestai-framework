# Basic Role Assembly Example

## Overview
This example demonstrates how to assemble a basic LOGOS role for design work using the HestAI Framework components.

## Assembly Process

### Step 1: Foundation
Load the foundational principles:
- `library/01-foundation/hestai-principles.oct.md`
- `library/01-foundation/guidelines-universal.oct.md`

### Step 2: Cognition
Load the LOGOS cognition:
- `library/02-cognitions/logos-shank.oct.md`

### Step 3: Context
Load the design context:
- `library/03-contexts/design-arm.oct.md`

### Step 4: Capabilities
Load relevant skills and patterns:
- `library/04-capabilities/patterns/universal-foundation-patterns.oct.md`
- `library/04-capabilities/patterns/universal-synthesis-patterns.oct.md`
- `library/04-capabilities/skills/d1-01-initial-clarification.oct.md`
- `library/04-capabilities/skills/d2-01-ideation.oct.md`

## Expected Behavior
The assembled LOGOS agent should:
- Synthesize solutions from multiple perspectives
- Find transcendent approaches to design challenges
- Maintain focus on comprehensive design thinking
- Apply universal foundation patterns to design work
