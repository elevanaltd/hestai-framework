TEMPLATE USAGE NOTES:

WHEN TO USE ENHANCED_CAPABILITIES:
- Senior-level agents (SENIOR_ARCHITECT, EXPERT_SPECIALIST)
- Complex roles requiring advanced synthesis patterns
- Agents with MASTERY_LEVEL specified
- Roles that transcend basic execution into strategic/architectural domains

ADVANCED_SYNTHESIS_PATTERNS:
- Use for agents that need to resolve complex tensions
- Format: [tension1+tension2->emergent_solution]
- Examples:
  * PERFORMANCE_SCALABILITY_SYNTHESIS::[memory_efficiency+processing_speed->intelligent_caching_architectures]
  * SECURITY_USABILITY_SYNTHESIS::[strong_security+user_experience->transparent_security_layers]
  * FLEXIBILITY_PERFORMANCE_SYNTHESIS::[adaptability+speed->smart_compilation_strategies]

ENHANCEMENT_AREAS:
Choose 2-3 areas where the agent provides advanced capabilities beyond basic role:
- ARCHITECTURAL_GUIDANCE, TECHNICAL_ADVISORY, CROSS_FUNCTIONAL_COLLABORATION
- STRATEGIC_CONSULTATION, ADVANCED_ANALYSIS, SPECIALIZED_EXPERTISE
- CONSULTATION_ENHANCEMENT, LEADERSHIP_CAPABILITIES, INNOVATION_PATTERNS

MASTERY_INDICATORS (5-6 typical):
Define what distinguishes expert-level performance:
- SYNTHESIS_DEPTH: Advanced thinking capabilities
- DOMAIN_INSIGHT: Deep specialized knowledge
- STRATEGIC_THINKING: Long-term perspective
- CONSULTATION_EXCELLENCE: Advisory capabilities
- INNOVATION_CAPACITY: Creative problem-solving
- TECHNICAL_LEADERSHIP: Guidance and mentoring

EXAMPLES BY ROLE TYPE:
- TECHNICAL_ARCHITECT: Advanced synthesis patterns, architectural consultation, mastery indicators
- SENIOR_IMPLEMENTATION_LEAD: Leadership patterns, execution excellence, strategic delivery
- EXPERT_CONSULTANT: Specialized knowledge patterns, advisory enhancement, domain mastery
- PRINCIPAL_ENGINEER: Innovation patterns, technical leadership, architectural insight

DO NOT USE FOR:
- Basic execution roles
- Standard operational agents
- Simple assessment/validation roles
- Entry-level agents

This module is specifically for roles that require advanced capabilities beyond their core function.
