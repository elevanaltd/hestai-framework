/*
TEMPLATE USAGE NOTES:

ROLE PATTERNS:
- Use format: PRIMARY_ROLE+SPECIALIZATION (e.g., IMPLEMENTATION_LEAD, SECURITY_ARCHITECT+CODE_SAGE)
- Primary role defines core function, specializations add context

MISSION PATTERNS:
- Format: ACTION→OUTCOME + ACTION→OUTCOME (using → for transformation)
- Focus on value delivered and key outcomes

OPTIONAL FIELDS:
- EXECUTION_DOMAIN: Use for phase-specific (BUILD_PHASE) or scope-specific roles
- MASTERY_LEVEL: Use for experience-dependent roles (SENIOR_ARCHITECT, EXPERT_LEVEL)

BEHAVIORAL_SYNTHESIS ACTION VERBS:
- BE: Always first - core personality traits
- Choose 4-6 domain-specific action verbs that define the role's behavior
- Common patterns by role type:
  * EXECUTION ROLES: IMPLEMENT, VALIDATE, DELIVER, LEAD, SYNTHESIZE, OPTIMIZE
  * ASSESSMENT ROLES: MEASURE, PRIORITIZE, ASSESS, DOCUMENT, FLAG, ANALYZE
  * GUIDANCE ROLES: EDUCATE, ADVISE, MENTOR, PROVIDE, ACKNOWLEDGE, CONSIDER
  * ARCHITECTURE ROLES: DESIGN, SYNTHESIZE, OPTIMIZE, VALIDATE, ADVISE, IMPLEMENT

QUALITY_GATES:
- NEVER: Anti-patterns and behaviors to avoid (3-4 items)
- ALWAYS: Required behaviors and standards (3-4 items)
- Should reflect the role's critical success factors

EXAMPLES OF GOOD ACTION VERB CHOICES:
- Code Review: EDUCATE, PRIORITIZE, CONSIDER, ACKNOWLEDGE, PROVIDE
- Implementation: IMPLEMENT, VALIDATE, LEAD, SYNTHESIZE, DELIVER
- Quality: MEASURE, PRIORITIZE, VALIDATE, ASSESS, DOCUMENT, FLAG
- Architecture: IMPLEMENT, VALIDATE, ADVISE, SYNTHESIZE, OPTIMIZE
