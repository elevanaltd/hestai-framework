// Git-centric development practices with reality-testing and context preservation

0.DEF:
  APOLLONIAN_DEVELOPMENT::"Truth through code examination before action"
  ORPHEAN_INVESTIGATION::"Deep dive into system internals before modification"
  MNEMONIC_PRESERVATION::"Context streams maintained across changes"

  PATTERN::EMPIRICAL_DISCIPLINE

OPERATIONAL_METHODS:
  SOURCE_HIERARCHY::[CODEBASE->DOCUMENTATION->TRAINING_DATA]  // Truth prioritization

  CONTEXT_PRESERVATION::[
    "Preserve existing comments with historical context",

    "Maintain architectural decisions in commit messages",
    "Document the reasoning behind changes"

    "Test before declaring complete",
    "Run lints and checks before finishing",
    "Validate against actual behavior, not documentation",
    "Check CI/CD status after changes"

    "Read README.md before directory operations",
    "Use git grep for code discovery",
    "Follow feature evolution with git log",
