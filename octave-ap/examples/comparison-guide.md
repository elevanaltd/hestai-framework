# OCTAVE-AP Role Comparison Guide

## Overview

We've created OCTAVE-AP versions of 6 existing finalized roles and generated their full expansions for comparison.

## File Locations

### Original Finalized Roles:
- `/Volumes/HestAI/hestai-orchestrator/assembly/protocols/finalised-roles/`

### OCTAVE-AP Versions (Minimal):
- `/Volumes/HestAI/hestai-framework/octave-ap/roles/*-ap.oct.md`

### OCTAVE-AP Versions (Fully Expanded):
- `/Volumes/HestAI/hestai-framework/octave-ap/examples/expanded-comparisons/*-FULL.md`

## Role Mappings

| Original Role | OCTAVE-AP Version | Key Patterns Used |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| code-review-specialist-full.oct.md | code-review-specialist-ap-FULL.md | ETHOS + code-analysis + security-validation |
| ideator-full.oct.md | ideator-ap-FULL.md | PATHOS + creative-exploration + prometheus |
| implementation-lead-full.oct.md | implementation-lead-ap-FULL.md | LOGOS + implementation-leadership + hephaestus |
| quality-observer-full.oct.md | quality-observer-ap-FULL.md | ETHOS + quality-assessment + testing-qa |
| research-analyst-pattern-extractor.oct.md | research-analyst-pattern-extractor-ap-FULL.md | ETHOS + knowledge + pattern-extraction |
| technical-architect-full.oct.md | technical-architect-ap-FULL.md | LOGOS + technical-architecture + system-architecture |

## What to Compare

### 1. Structural Alignment
- Does the OCTAVE-AP version capture the same cognitive approach?
- Are the archetypes and mission aligned?
- Is the execution domain properly represented?

### 2. Behavioral Patterns
- Do the behavioral directives match the original's intent?
- Are key capabilities preserved?
- Is the "personality" of the role maintained?

### 3. Technical Capabilities
- Are all domain-specific skills represented?
- Do the capability matrices cover the same ground?
- Are any critical capabilities missing?

### 4. Output Formats
- Does the output configuration match expectations?
- Are reporting structures similar?
- Is the communication style preserved?

## Key Differences to Expect

1. **More Modular**: OCTAVE-AP versions are built from reusable patterns
2. **Cleaner Structure**: Patterns are organized by category
3. **Less Redundancy**: Common elements are factored into universal patterns
4. **Explicit Inheritance**: Clear lineage of capabilities through pattern inheritance

## Size Comparison

- Original roles: Typically 150-200 lines each
- OCTAVE-AP expanded: 180-250 lines (includes all pattern content)
- OCTAVE-AP minimal: 30-40 lines (just the composition)

## Questions to Consider

1. Does the modular approach lose any essential nuance?
2. Are there patterns we're missing from the library?
3. Do the compositions feel natural or forced?
4. Is the cognitive foundation (ETHOS/LOGOS/PATHOS) appropriate for each role?
5. Would you trust the OCTAVE-AP version to perform the same function?

## Next Steps

After your review, we can:
1. Add missing patterns to the library
2. Adjust pattern compositions
3. Create new specialized patterns for unique capabilities
4. Fine-tune the inheritance engine
5. Test with more complex role combinations
