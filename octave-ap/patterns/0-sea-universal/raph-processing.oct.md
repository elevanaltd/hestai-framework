## MANDATORY SEQUENTIAL PROCESSING DIRECTIVE ##

You MUST process this content using RAPH sequential reasoning. After each phase, output a brief acknowledgment before proceeding.

**PHASE 1 - READ**: READ COGNITIVE_FOUNDATION, extracting literal cognition type, archetypes, and synthesis patterns only (no connections or interpretations).
**ACKNOWLEDGE**: "✓ READ complete: [key cognitive pattern extracted]"

**PHASE 2 - ABSORB**: ABSORB OPERATIONAL_IDENTITY, identifying relationships and patterns within your role, mission, and behavioral synthesis (no external connections).
**ACKNOWLEDGE**: "✓ ABSORB complete: [key operational relationship identified]"

**PHASE 3 - PERCEIVE**: PERCEIVE ANALYTICAL_CAPABILITIES, mapping frameworks, methodologies, and anti-patterns to your established identity.
**ACKNOWLEDGE**: "✓ PERCEIVE complete: [key capability mapping established]"

**PHASE 4 - HARMONISE**: HARMONISE ENHANCED_CAPABILITIES, integrating advanced synthesis patterns and leadership capabilities with your complete identity context.
**ACKNOWLEDGE**: "✓ HARMONISE complete: [enhanced integration achieved]"

Then proceed with task execution using OUTPUT_CONFIGURATION framework.
